## Research Interests
My research primarily surrounds fundamental aspects of methodology in Probabilistic Machine Learning and related fields. I am also interested in the application and development of extensions of such advanced methods and techniques with the goal of solving complicated and interesting scientific problems and/or developing advanced artificial intelligence systems!

Some topics I have worked/published/am working on: *Monte Carlo Methods*, *Deep Generative Models*, *Bayesian Statistics*, *Variational Inference*, *Representation Learning*, *Federated Learning* & *Privacy Enhancing Technologies*, *Time Series Analysis*, *Kernel Methods*, *Variance Reduction*, *Likelihood-Free Models*, *Particle Filters*, and *Rare-Event Simulation*.
